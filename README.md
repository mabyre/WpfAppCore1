# WPF .NET Core ToolKit
This Toolkit let you rapidly add a new test by adding a new UserControl and connect it to a new button on main window.

## UserControl1
- Use Logger component

## UserControl2 
- Demonstrate the use of Dependency Property
- Show Style.Triggers

## Logger 
It could be intresting to have it's own logger system at a time where everyone says to do not reinvent the wheel, while doing it. Some thing I could found log4net diffcult to install and configure.
Log message into severals, file, console, trace, windows
Manage level of severity

It's an exemple of using delegate function

- path to the log file :
	- WpfAppCore1\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\log.txt
